## Amazon Lightsail Containers Workshop

Running container-based applications offer several advantages including portability, better security and ease of scaling. Running single container is easy, deploying container and scaling is still a fairly complex thing to do. This is where Amazon Lightsail Containers could help.

Amazon Lightsail Containers is an easy way to run containers in the cloud. Just provide a Docker image and you will automatically get a domain, load balancer with TLS certificate, blue/green deployment and more. Since it's Amazon Lightsail the costs are fixed and you won't need a calculator.

In this workshop you will learn how to deploy an application on Amazon Lightsail Containers. There will be three deployment workshops provided, how to deploy Node.js, Python and PHP on Amazon Lightsail Containers.

In each workshop, the main points discussed are:

- Installing the Lightsail Control Plugin
- Creating a container Image
- Creating a Container Service in Amazon Lightsail
- Push Container Image to Amazon Lightsail
- Deploy container
- Update container Image
- Push the latest version of container Image
- Scaling container by increasing number of nodes
- Rollback container to previous deployment
